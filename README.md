## External Requirements

At this moment we do not have a complete list of the necessary APIs and Libraries. We will add one as soon as possible. Here are the ones we have at the moment.
*CURRENTLY USED:

* Cors Headers (pip install django-cors-headers)
* Stock Prices API: [Finnhub.io](https://finnhub.io/docs/api)

## Setup

#### If you've already cloned/pulled:
Run `pipenv update` to sync the pipfile, then install and shell

### Regardless
Navigate to the root directory of the project. And run:

`pipenv install`

This will install all of the required Python modules.
Activate the virtual environment with

`pipenv shell`

Next run all migrations for database with

`./manage.py makemigrations`

and apply them

`./manage.py migrate`
#### If you are getting issues with the python version, make sure your ide is using the pipenv interpreter

## Running

`./manage.py runserver`

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

# Testing

Running tests:

`./manage.py test`

Location of tests:

`./stocks/tests.py`

## Testing Technology

TBD.
