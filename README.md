## External Requirements

At this moment we do not have a complete list of the necessary APIs and Libraries. We will add one as soon as possible. Here are the ones we have at the moment.

* [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/)
* [pytrends](https://pypi.org/project/pytrends/)

## Setup

N/A.

## Running

`manage.py runserver`

# Deployment

Webapps need a deployment section that explains how to get it deployed on the 
Internet. These should be detailed enough so anyone can re-deploy if needed
. Note that you **do not put passwords in git**. 

# Testing

In 492 you will write automated tests. When you do you will need to add a 
section that explains how to run them.

The unit tests are in `/test/unit`.

The behavioral tests are in `/test/casper/`.

## Testing Technology

TBD.

## Running Tests

In due time.
